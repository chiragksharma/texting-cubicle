Dear Mr./Ms. Last Name,

 

I have 4 years of experience as a Software Developer at my previous company. I came across an interesting position of Software Tester (Job Reference Number 9467) on your website. Company XYZ is renowned for testing all kinds of software and applications before they are released. As I know how they were programmed, I would be able to quickly detect all bugs and errors that need to be rectified. My skillset and expertise makes me a valuable asset to your organization.

After graduating with a degree in Computer Science, I worked at Company ABC as a software developer for 4 years. I designed and programmed engineering software that students use in academia. I now want to challenge myself in a new environment and your company offers just that.

I have attached a cover letter, resume, and certificates for your consideration. Please take a moment to go through them to get a better idea of who I am.

I would love to talk to you in more detail regarding this amazing opportunity at your company. I look forward to hearing back from you regarding my application.

 

Sincerely,

                            Dear Ms. Fran Braden,

I’m writing to give my formal notice that I’ll be leaving my role as Office Manager for Larry and Keets Financial Partners on July 31.

I’ve recently received an offer to serve as an executive assistant at a small startup, and after careful consideration I’m excited to explore this new path in my career journey.

I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunities I’ve been provided working on the Operations team for the past four years. It’s been a wonderful experience to work for such a great company and help in solving Larry and Keets’ mission to provide better financial support for older employees.

Please let me know if I can be of any assistance during this transition. Thank you for all your guidance. I wish you all the best, and look forward to keeping in touch.

Sincerely,
George Lin



Obviously, feel free to adjust this a bit based on your experience and your company culture, then submit it via the typical procedures at your company.

Sure, it may sit in the depths of HR until the end of time, but you can be sure of two things: One, your former boss (and future reference) will read it and be impressed. And two, if you ever decide to come back to your company (hey, it happens), it’s a very good thing that last thing on file is a great, professionally written letter of resignation.

Happy quitting!

                            During my time at [company], I have learned a lot and grown professionally. Thank you for all of your guidance and support during my employment.

                            Dear [Manager’s Name],

                            I am writing to formally notify you of my resignation from the position of [job title] at [company name]. My last day with the company will be [date].
                            
                            During my time at [company name], I have come to realise that the scope of the role is unfortunately not what I had anticipated, and as such, I would like to explore other opportunities. 
                            
                            Thank you for understanding, I truly appreciate all the support and guidance you have provided in the time I have worked for the business.
                            
                            Please let me know how I can help to support a smooth transition over the next [notice period in weeks].
